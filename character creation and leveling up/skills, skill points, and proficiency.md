# SKILLS:

skills can be used to determine how good your character is at any given task which is placed into a category.

the skills are as follows:

crafting (dex, int)

atunement (cha, wis)

arcana (int, wis)

athletics (str, dex)

deception (int, cha)

diplomacy (wis, cha)

Fortitude (str, vit)

Stealth (dex, wis)

Perception (int, wis)

theology (wis, cha)

medicine (dex, int)

nature (int, wis)

abbreviates of stats are placed next to a skill to show what makes up your skill value. 

for example, with little to no training or experience, a character with a +2 in dexterity and a +1 in strength will have an athletics skill of +3

this value can be used to determine what is added to a D20 roll during a skill check, which involves attempting to meet or exceed a number made up by your dungeon master that will determine whether you succeed or fail a given task.

for example when attempting to save a comrade from a heavy falling object, the DM may ask you to make an athletics check, in which case you roll a d20 and add your athletics value to the number rolled. 
if you meet or exceed the DM's made up number, you succeed and save your comrade from being crushed to death.

typically the difficulty of skill checks are as follows 

| difficulty | DC or AC (number you need to meet) | 
| --- | --- |
| easy | 1-6 |
| moderate | 7-10 |
| difficult | 11-13 |
| hard | 14-17 |
| extreme | 18-22 |
| impossible | 23+ |

on the rare occasion that you land a 1 or 20 on the d20 (not including bonuses), you have rolled a crit fail or crit success respectively.

crit fails reward you with the experience of the worst reasonable outcome (such as stubbing your toe and yelping on a stealth check) 

crit successes allow you to bask in the glory of earning the best reasonable outcome a check has to offer (such as letting you walk unreasonably close to a guard on a stealth check, but not quite skyrim levels of temporal distortion)

# Skill points:

- when you create a character and level up, you gain skill points which allow you to improve your known skills by 1 for each point, until youve invested 5 points in a skill, after which it starts costing 2 skill points.
- Investing skill points has the result you probably expect, raising your bonus in any given skill by one. aside from that there are no limitations around which skills you can or cant improve with skill points.
- skill points gained per level are as follows:

| LVL | skill points gained |  |LVL (11-20) | skill points gained |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 4 | | 11 | 4
| 2 | 2 | | 12 | 4
| 3 | 2 | | 13 | 5
| 4 | 2 | | 14 | 5
| 5 | 3 | | 15 | 5
| 6 | 3 | | 16 | 5
| 7 | 3 | | 17 | 6
| 8 | 3 | | 18 | 6
| 9 | 4 | | 19 | 6 
| 10 | 4 | | 20 | 6

# Weapon proficiency

- every martial may choose to be proficient in 2 weapons (fighters get 4)
- they add their proficiency bonus to accuracy rolls when attacking
- weapon proficiency per level is as follows

| lvl | total proficiency bonus | lvl (11-20) | total bonus |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 1 | +2 | 11 | +7 |
| 2 | +2 | 12 | +7 |
| 3 | +3 | 13 | +8 |
| 4 | +3 | 14 | +8 |
| 5 | +4 | 15 | +9 |
| 6 | +4 | 16 | +9 |
| 7 | +5 | 17 | +10 |
| 8 | +5 | 18 | +10 |
| 9 | +6 | 19 | +11 |
| 10 | +6 | 20 | +12 |
