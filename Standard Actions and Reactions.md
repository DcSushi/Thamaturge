# Actions

Object Actions: 
  - Interacting with a given object may take any number of actions given context, however typically retreiving a potion from a bag and drinking it would typically take 2 actions, whereas ripping a potion from a bandolier would only take 1 action point.
      - the first action point which would be spent on item interactions is instead free
  - Tables can be flipped to make cover, doors can be opened, levers flipped, and a torch can spark the brush alight. Pretty much any mundane action in which the dungeon master must make a decision about action cost is considered an object interaction.

Brawl Actions: (potentially unarmed strikes in this context could be monk exclusive) WORK IN PROGRESS
  - A shove, bewildering, and unarmed melee strikes are made by rolling for as a "brawl action". Firstly, the attacker rolls an athletics check, and the defender uses their Passive Fortitude (10 + their fortitude total), or for example: if the defender has a fortitude of 7, their passive fortitude would equal 17.
    - On a success, you may deal unarmed strike damage, kick the target backwards 1 tile (if they are at most 1 size larger than you) and flinch them, bewilder them (lower their AC by 2 until the end of their next turn) and flinch them, or another "brawl action" which may become avaliable to you through other means.
