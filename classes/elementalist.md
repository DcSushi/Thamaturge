### DRAIN ELEMENTS:
- for 2 Action points you may drain energy from nature to gain elemental mana equal 4 + CORE and cause a unique effect to the drained area.
  - you may only drain elements if there is a source of energy within range (5 tiles) (air counts as having heat, so its almost always viable to draw heat from an area)
- (elements with a * next to them must be unlocked via optional features later in the class)
  - the elements you may drain from the world are as follows:

| element drained | effect on the surrounding environment |
|---|---|
| fire | a 2 tile radius is coated in ice. The surface is considered difficult terrain and creatures who take actions on the ice are flinched |
| thunder | all electrical devices and machines in a 2 tile radius are drained of electricity |
| radiant | the light is extinguished and a 2 tile radius is coated in magical darkness which you may see through, but others may not. the darkness is extinguished when your radiant mana is expended |
| healing * | all creatures in a 2 tile radius take necrotic damage equal to drain elements mana |
| necrotic | |
| earth | |
### ABSORB ELEMENTS: 

- when you are struck by a magical attack, you may spend one reaction point (1RP) to block a portion of the attack equal to 1d6 + CORE and gain mana equal to 50% of the damage blocked.
    - mana absorbed is determined by the element of the attack. if the attack dealt 2 types of damage, you absorb both types of mana in porportion to how much damage they dealt

- optional feature:
  
  - Kineticist:
    - you may use absorb elements on physical attacks as well as elemental ones. one third (rounded down) of all damage absorbed is converted to wild mana
  
  - Conduit body:
    - for 3 AP, you may drain elements and immediately cast a spell using only the mana you just absorbed

  - Mana coated blade:
    - for every 5 mana stored, your weapon attacks deal 2 additional damage of the mana's type and your weapon attacks are considered magical
