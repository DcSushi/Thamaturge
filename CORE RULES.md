# COMBAT INTERACTIONS:

## Flinching:
  * when a creature is interupted by something such as an attack or other major disturbances the creature flinches, recieving a -3 penalty to whatever action they were attempting.

## Surrounded/Fortified:
  * each creature has an area of influence (or AoI) which extends 1 tile from them.
  * if a creatures area of influence is completely filled by eather other creatures' AoIs or neutral tiles (such as terrain) they are considered surrounded or fortified depending on whether the surrounding creatures are hostile or friendly
  * one can have their AoI eclipsed by enemies but not be surrounded if an ally also covers atleast 2 tiles.
  * neutral tiles contribute to whichever side has the majority

## Cover:
  * if a creature is under full cover from an attacker, they cannot be targeted by single target spells or attacks
  * if a creature is under hlaf cover, they recieve a +3 to their AC temporarily
    * hiding directly behind a 1 tile structure counts as full cover from attackers
    * partially being covered by a 1 tile structure counts as half cover from attackers
