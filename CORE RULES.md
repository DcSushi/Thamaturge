# RESTING:
- a ration is about 1 half of a potato. usually 1 - 2 copper per ration
- exhaustion ranges from stages 0 to 10
    - every stage of exhaustion reduces all skill checks and attack rolls by 1 
    - if a character reaches stage 10 of exhaustion, they pass out.
    - if a fully exhausted creature does not recieve proper care (DC 15 - patient's VIT check using atleast 3 rations) within 2 days they die
      
## long rest:

- Long rests require shelter to gain the full benefit.
- proper shelter and 5 rations per traveler will restore all party members to 100% hp and mana
- shelter contributes to 15% of health and mana regenerated. the quality of shelter can range anywhere deducting 0 - 15% using DM discresion 
- each missing ration removes 5% hp and mana
- a days events incur 1 exhaustion if 2 or less rations were eaten outside of short rests
- a days events incur 3 exhaustion if nothing has been eaten
- long resting with full rations and shelter removes 4 exhaustion

## short rest:

- you may eat up to 4 rations
- you restore 25% missing health and mana with 1 ration, 30% on 2, 35% on 3, and 40% on 4
- eating 4 rations on a short rest removes 1 exhaustion

# COMBAT INTERACTIONS:

## dual wielding:
 - when you hold 2 one handed weapons, after making an attack with one weapon, you may make an attack with your other weapon for only 1 action.

## Flinching:
  * when a creature is interupted by something such as an attack or other major disturbances the creature flinches, recieving a -3 penalty to whatever action they were attempting if they fail a fortitude save.

## Surrounded/Fortified:
  * each creature has an area of influence (or AoI) which extends 1 tile from them.
  * if a creatures area of influence is completely filled by eather other creatures' AoIs or neutral tiles (such as terrain) they are considered surrounded or fortified depending on whether the surrounding creatures are hostile or friendly
  * one can have their AoI eclipsed by enemies but not be surrounded if an ally also covers atleast 2 tiles.
  * neutral tiles contribute to whichever side has the majority
  * surrounded creatures have a -3 AC
  * fortified creatures have a +3 AC

## Cover:
  * if a creature is under full cover from an attacker, they cannot be targeted by single target spells or attacks
  * if a creature is under hlaf cover, they recieve a +3 to their AC temporarily
    * hiding directly behind a 1 tile structure counts as full cover from attackers
    * partially being covered by a 1 tile structure counts as half cover from attackers
      
# REACTIONS:
   * if you do not spend all of your action points before the end of a turn, the leftovers are converted to reaction points which may be used on reactions
   * some reactions have triggers, and some may be used at any time
   * up to 2 unused reaction points are added to your total action points at the start of your next turn

### opportunity attack:
   * when a creature within 1 tile of you takes an action which does not target you, you may spend 2 reaction points to make a melee attack against them
         * if the attack hits, the target is flinched
