# LVL 1

## [Spellcasting](spellcasting/enchanterlist):

* the enchanter casts spells using runes which can be placed on surfaces.
  * when casting spells, you instead place a rune on certain surfaces within the spells range, using the same amount of actions as the spell specifies.
    * with ranged spells, the rune may be placed on the ground, walls, or other solid surfaces like trees.
    * for spells with touch range, the rune may be placed on anything, including armor or held items (place one on a throwing item to create large amounts of burst)
       * you may also cast ranged spells in this way if you choose
* runes may be detonated at any time by using an action point or reaction point. If the surface your rune is on is destroyed, the spell is lost.
   * when the surface is destroyed, you may immediately use a reaction point to instead detonate the spell
* you may use 2 action points to safely absorb mana from any placed runes within 1 tile, erasing them and refunding 50% of the spent mana
* when targeted spells are detonated, you choose the target, determine line of sight, and recieve all positional bonuses from the perspective of the rune.
   * the rune attack often recieves bonuses from high ground, suprise attacks, and often circumvents cover based bonuses.
   * targeted spells can only be detonated on targets which you can see (or know the position of within 1 tile of certainty)
* area of effect spells are centered on the rune
* some spells are unique to enchanter and thus have unqiue casting methods. pay attention to the wording of enchanter spells!

## signature spellcasting:
- once per day, you may cast a cantrip you know for free
   - this feature gains an additional use every time you level up
   - all cantrips are completely free once a character reaches a combined level of 10 in any spellcasting classes

## Choice feature: Runic form 

* runic sight
   * you can see through your runes and can cast spells even if only your rune would see them
   * you may also spend 5 mana to place a rune of sight
      * at any time you may spend an action point to take a glance through this rune and see all that it sees, potentially making vision based skill checks
      * you may also set the rune to alert you when it sees a creature. If this effect is triggered, it consumes 5 mana (if you are out of mana it consumes hp)
      * the rune is dispelled when you are knocked unconsious

* runic turret
   * you may spend 2 action points to place a runic turret on a surface within 6 tiles using the ranged rune rules
   * using this rune, you may cast spell attacks through it, using the normal runic spell attack rules
   * If a turn goes by where the turret rune doesnt cast a spell attack, you may choose for the turret to attack with a generic ranged spell attack
      * the spell attack has a -2 accuracy penalty and deals 2d4 lightning damage

* runic traps
   * area of effect spells are invisible upon casting. the following rune is automatically detonated when a hostile creature occupies or passes through the same tile as it. you cannot cast runes on tiles when a hostile creature already occupies
   * area of effect spells return the full amount of mana when absorbed

* bonding:
   * a tattoo on your body grants you advanced physical attributes, increasing your movement speed by 1 tile, providing 2 additional mana per level in any spellcasting class, and raising your armor class by 1

* branding:
   * your spells leave searing brands on your enemies. When an enemy fails a saving throw against one of your spells, for the next 3 hours you know where they are and a searing, painful brand is left on their body.
   * you may spend an action point to cause any number of branded creatures to take 2d6 fire damage at any time while they are branded, alerting them to the presence of the brand and allowing them to make a charisma saving throw against your spellcasting DC to negate damage from the brand for the next hour.
   * you may channel your concentration on a brand for an hour to cause a brand on a single creature to last for 24 hours instead.
   * the brand may be removed via an arcana check equal your spell DC, or amputation of the limb the brand is attached to. Dispell curse also removes the brand

    * when you cast a spell which provides benefit to a creature, you may spend 5 additional mana to heal them for (1d4 per level) + CORE hp.
