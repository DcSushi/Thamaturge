# THIS CLASS IS THE EQUIVALENT SPELLCASTER TO FIGHTER:
- simple when soloclassed, but rewarding when multiclassed.

## design goals
- Spells are not tiered inherrently
- you may choose to tier up spells by paying additional mana
- at levels where you unlock a new highest tier, you will be asked to choose an upgrade for each of the spells you currently know, given that you choose to cast them at the affected tier or higher.
- tier 2 effects generally change the shape of the spell. I.E. shield from dnd could become a bubble shield, it could count as the target permanently being behind cover, it could do damage to creatures who get within 1 tile of the target.
- tier 3 effects are less impactful, generally they change the ideal use case into something more narrow, but dont outright downgrade the spell for other situations. (keep in mind you may pay for the tier 2 upgrade, but not tier 3 each time you cast the spell.)
- other spells which you might learn later could have a minimum tier above 1 (maybe too complicated), or spells could have a level requirement (would be like getting a birthday present. you would choose all of its upgrades at once, up to your current max tier when you learn it)
- on level where you dont gain a new max tier, you could rework a spell of your choice (maybe idk. playtest it) (guard rails for players who mess up, not intended to deinsentivise players from making a suboptimal choice early on to support a strong choice later.)
- spell list generally wont have many redundant upgraded effects, but some are okay if the core tier 1 effect is different.

# SPELL EXAMPLE

### laser beam
- spell data (basic effect, mana cost, action cost)

- table of upgrade effects

| tier 1 | tier 2 | tier 3|
| --- | --- | --- |
| N/A | A) beam becomes a shotgun of several small blasts w/ a max range    | A) stuff    |
| N/A | B) beam explodes on hit     | B)  thing   | 
| N/A | C) beam bounces from one target to the next     | C)  shit   |
