- Elementalist spells function quite differently to normal spells 
- they have shape, upcasting capabilities, damage, and casting times
- all other features are determined by element
- element is determined by the type of mana used to cast the spell
- wild mana can be cast as though it were any element
- no 2 elements may mix when casting unless otherwise specified
- you may spend additional mana to improve attributes of the spell

## attributes:

- 5 mana
- 2 AP
- 2 tile range (+1 per 2 mana spent)
- 3d8 elemental damage (+1d8 per 3 mana spent)
- spell DC (+1 per 2 mana spent)

## elemental effect chart

| element | saving throw | effect |
|---|---|---|
| fire | athletics | coat the affected tiles in fire if flammable, making them difficult terrain and dealing 1 fire damage per d8 of damage dealt for every tile a creature walks through |
| lightning | fortitude | creatures who fail the saving throw have 1 AP and 2 tiles of movement removed at the start of their next turn |
| ice | fortitude | the ground is coated in a layer of ice, creating difficult terrain. creatures who take actions on the ice make an athletics save or are flinched |
| force | athletics | creatures who fail the save are pushed back a number of tiles equal to half the d8s of damage dealt rounded up. If a creature impacts a wall with tiles of knockback left to spare, they take 1d6 force damage for every leftover tile
