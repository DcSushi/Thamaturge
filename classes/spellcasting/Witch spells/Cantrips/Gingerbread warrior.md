you transform a baked good within 1 tile into a cookie warrior 
which deals 2d4 damage at the end of your turn to anyone it can attach itself to.

on later turns, you may spend an action point to command all your cookie warriors to move 2 tiles towards a point. you may also spend 1 action point to command all cookie warriors to attach to the nearest target (enemies prioritized, but if the only creature within 1 tile is an ally then it will attach to them)

- to attach itself to a target, it forces a nearby creature to make an athletics save. on a failure the cookie warrior climbs onto the creature and deals 2d4 piercing damage by biting or stabbing the creature.

- you may also choose to spend an additional action point to throw the cookie before transforming it mid air.
    - make a spell attack roll against a target within range (4 + str tiles) the cookie warrior deals dammage and attaches to the target if the attack lands
 
+ a creature may spend 1 ation point to make an athletics check against your spell dc, breaking the cookie in half on a success.
