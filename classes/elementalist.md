absorbs ambient energy to convert mana into elemental mana
cannot cast spells unless using elemental mana
can absorb magic items or other unique sources of energy to gain "wild mana" which can cast non-elemental spells, or be substituted for any elemental mana type
absorb elements converts energy in the area into elemental mana. When this happens, an opposite element takes its place
    - for example: you absorb fire mana from a flame. the surrounding area is coated in ice, and is notably very cold.
    - sitiations like this may cause need for a saving throw. for example if one wants to cross the ice, they would make a dex save against your elemntal DC (8 + core + lvl)
+ when you are attacked with an elemental attack, you may attempt to block it with a reaction point. the amount blocked is (3d6 + core + lvl). half of the blocked damage converts mana into elemental mana of the attacks type
features: 
1) conduit body: cast a spell and absorb elements all at once for 3 action points
2) kineticist: you can absorb elements on explosions to gain wild mana. additionaly, using 1 reaction point you may attempt to block a kinetic attack against you. roll 3d6, and add your core and lvl.
   however much damage you blocked, convert half that damage into wild mana

### DRAIN ELEMENTS:
- for 2 Action points you may drain energy from nature to gain elemental mana equal to the average roll of absorb elements and cause the surrounding area to be lacking in the absorbed element.
  - you may only drain elements if there is a potent source of the energy being drained to target within range (3 tiles)
- (elements with a * next to them must be unlocked via optional features later in the class)
  - the elements you may drain from the world are as follows:

| element drained | effect on the surrounding environment |
|---|---|
| fire | a 2 tile radius is coated in ice. The surface is considered difficult terrain and creatures who take actions on the ice are flinched |
| thunder | all electrical devices and machines in a 2 tile radius are drained of electricity |
| radiant | the light is extinguished and a 2 tile radius is coated in magical darkness which you may see through, but others may not |
| healing * |
