    - when you hit a creature with a spell attack, all creatures gain +1 to accuracy rolls against them until the start of your next turn. This stacks

LVL 2

- Arcane tradition
  - choose a spell type for which your spells cost 1 less mana 
    + evocation, conjuration, transmutation, illusion, or necromancy

	- Evocation
		+ you may choose up to 3 tiles within your spells which are not affected. 
		+ this does not only apply to evocation or damaging spells (it works on faerie fire too!)
	
	- conjuration
		+ as 2 reaction points at any time, you may conjure a 1 tile wide and 1 tile high surface
		+ if you conjure it during a creatures movement, their movement is stopped and they are considered flinched for the rest of their turn

	- Transmutation
		+ you gain + 2 to alchemy lore (add it as a lore skill)
		+ when you touch a surface you may alter its properties 
			+ 2 action points if used against a creatures armor (melee spell attack which reduces opponents AC by 4 for their next 3 turns)
			+ If used against a surface it can dissolve, or harden any surface in a 1 tile radius (takes 30 seconds)

	- Illusion
		+ the brace reaction raises your AC by 3 instead of 2
		+ using 2 action points, you may conjure a an illusion which you may move now and on subsequent turns using 1 action point
			+ It has its own area of influence only against creatures which fail an intelligence saving throw
			+ This affects the surrounded and fortified conditions, AND if the illusion would have been able to use an opportunity attack, you may instead make an opportunity attack with a spell of your choice

	- Necromancy 
		+ You know false life and cast it at half the mana cost (-1 from chosen school is applied beforehand)
		+ when you land a spell attack you regain 2 hp
		+ if a creature dies when under the effect of one of your spells, you regain 2 mana and  hp
