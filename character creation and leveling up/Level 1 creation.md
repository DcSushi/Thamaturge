# STATS

- to roll your stats:
  
  1) all stats start at 4
  2) roll 2 sets of d6 6 times while rerolling 1s and 2s.
  3) assign each dice pair to a stat and add their values
  4) then make a coinflip for each stat. on heads give the stat a +1 (the result is assigned to a stat before the coin is flipped. no swappies)
  5) add 3 among all the stats, divided however you like
  6) maximum of 16 for each stat

# HP 

+ each class has their own hp dice (2d6 or 2d8 usually)
  + at level one, first assume a maximum roll, then roll the dice. Add the rolled value and twice your vitality modifier to your total HP.
      example: 2d6 hp with +2 vitality
  - 12 + (7) + 4 = 23 HP at level one
  - for further levels, add your hp dice and twice your vitality modifier again: 
  - 23 + (8) + 4 = 35 HP at level two
