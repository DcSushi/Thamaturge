## LEVEL ONE

### [Spellcasting](spellcasting.md/enchanterlist.md):

* the enchanter casts spells using runes which can be placed on surfaces.
  * when casting spells, you instead place a rune on certain surfaces within the spells range, using the same amount of actions as the spell specifies.
    * with ranged spells, the rune may be placed on the ground, walls, or other solid surfaces like trees
    * for spells with touch range, the rune may be placed on anything, including armor or held items (place one on a throwing item to create large amounts of burst)
* runes may be detonated at any time by using an action point or reaction point. If the surface your rune is on is destroyed, the spell is lost.
   * when the surface is destroyed, you may immediately use a reaction point to instead detonate the spell
* you may use 2 action points to safely absorb mana from any placed runes within 1 tile, erasing them and refunding 50% of the spent mana
* when targeted spells are detonated, you choose the target, determine line of sight, and recieve all positional bonuses from the perspective of the rune.
   * the rune attack often recieves bonuses from high ground, suprise attacks, and often circumvents cover based bonuses.
   * targeted spells can only be detonated on targets which you can see (or know the position of within 1 tile of certainty)
* area of effect spells are centered on the rune
* some spells are unique to enchanter and thus have unqiue casting methods. pay attention to the wording of enchanter spells!

### Runic form (choose 1)

* runic sight
   * you can see through your runes and can cast spells even if only your rune would see them
   * you may also spend 5 mana to place a rune of sight
      * at any time you may spend an action point to take a glance through this rune and see all that it sees, potentially making vision based skill checks
      * you may also set the rune to alert you when it sees a creature. If this effect is triggered, it consumes 5 mana (if you are out of mana it consumes hp)
      * the rune is dispelled when you are knocked unconsious

* runic turret
   * you may spend 2 action points to place a runic turret on a surface within 6 tiles using the ranged rune rules
   * using this rune, you may cast spell attacks through it, using the normal runic spell attack rules
   * If a turn goes by where the turret rune doesnt cast a spell attack, you may choose for the turret to attack with a generic ranged spell attack
      * the spell attack has a -2 accuracy penalty and deals 2d4 lightning damage

* runic traps
   * area of effect spells are invisible upon casting. the following rune is automatically detonated when a hostile creature occupies or passes through the same tile as it. you cannot cast runes on tiles when a hostile creature already occupies
   * area of effect spells return the full amount of mana when absorbed
