| Agonizing blast | 2 | Attunement 5 | the target makes an attunement save equal to (18 + attunement). On a failure a creature spends an action point wailing in agony, flinching all unwarned creatures within 2 tiles. For every additional 3 points that the creature fails the saving throw by, they forfeit an additional action point. If a creature rolls lower than their action points would allow, they spend all their action points harming themselves |
