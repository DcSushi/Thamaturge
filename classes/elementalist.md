absorbs ambient energy to convert mana into elemental mana
cannot cast spells unless using elemental mana
can absorb magic items or other unique sources of energy to gain "wild mana" which can cast non-elemental spells, or be substituted for any elemental mana type
absorb elements converts energy in the area into elemental mana. When this happens, an opposite element takes its place
    - for example: you absorb fire mana from a flame. the surrounding area is coated in ice, and is notably very cold.
    - sitiations like this may cause need for a saving throw. for example if one wants to cross the ice, they would make a dex save against your elemntal DC (8 + core + lvl)
