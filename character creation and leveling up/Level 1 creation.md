# STATS

- to roll your stats:
  
  1) all stats start at 5
  2) roll 2 sets of d4 6 times while rerolling 1s.
  3) assign each dice pair to a stat and add their values
  4) then make a coinflip for each stat. on heads give the stat a +1 (the result is assigned to a stat before the coin is flipped. no swappies)
  5) add 8 among all the stats, divided however you like
  6) maximum of 16 for each stat

+ Example roll:
  
S 5, D 5, V 5, W 5, I 5, C 5

2d4 rolls: 5, 7, 5, 5, 4, 6

S 9, D 12, V 11, W 10, I 10, C 10

+ 1  + 0   + 0   + 0   + 1   + 1  <---- coin flips 

+ 0  + 3   + 1   + 1   + 2   + 1  <---- 8 freely allocated points

S 10, D 15, V 12, W 11, I 13, C 12 <--- final stats for level 1 

# HP 

+ each class has their own hp dice (2d6 or 2d8 usually)
  + at level one, first assume a maximum roll, then roll the dice. Add the rolled value and twice your vitality modifier to your total HP.
      example: 2d6 hp with +2 vitality
  - 12 + (7) + 4 = 23 HP at level one
  - for further levels, add your hp dice and twice your vitality modifier again: 
  - 23 + (8) + 4 = 35 HP at level two
+ VERY IMPORTANT: if you gain vitality later on, make sure to add the appropriate HP for every level youve gained
